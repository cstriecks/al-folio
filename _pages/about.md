My research focus lies in the field of advanced cryptographic building blocks with strong provable security guarantees for securing modern connected systems (e.g., the Internet of things, cloud computing, and secure distributed communication) with an emphasis on real-world and versatile cryptographic features (e.g., forward-secret, fine-grained, and post-quantum cryptography).

In 2015, I received my PhD in cryptography from the <a href="https://kit.edu" target="_blank" rel="nooppener">Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT)</a> in Germany under the supervision of <a href="https://people.inf.ethz.ch/dhofheinz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prof. Dennis Hofheinz</a> with a focus on strong security guarantees for the cryptographic building blocks identity-based encryption, digital signatures, and revocation schemes.

I was involved in standardization activities that include <a href="https://portal.etsi.org/STF/STFs/STFHomePages/STF529" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ETSI STF 529</a> within <a href="http://www.etsi.org/technologies-clusters/technologies/cyber-security" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ETSI TC CYBER</a> (on standardizing Attribute-Based Encryption for access control and data privacy). Furthermore, I am part of the <a href="https://www.enisa.europa.eu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ENISA</a> List of Experts for field B: ICT Security Standardisation and Certification in category 1) Applied Cryptography (Algorithms, Protocols, Standards).

Furthermore, I served as a PC member for <a href="https://malb.io/imacc2019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IMACC 2019</a> and <a href="https://www.ifip-summerschool.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IFIP Summer School 2019</a>, and reviewed for <a href="https://www.sigsac.org/ccs/CCS2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ACM CCS 2020</a>, <a href="https://pkc.iacr.org/2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PKC 2020</a>, <a href="https://crypto.iacr.org/2019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CRYPTO 2019</a>, <a href="http://www.ieee-security.org/TC/EuroSP2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EuroS&P 2018</a>, <a href="https://pkc.iacr.org/2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PKC 2018</a>, <a href="http://sacworkshop.org/SAC17/SAC2017.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SAC 2017</a>, <a href="https://www.iacr.org/workshops/pkc2017/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PKC 2017</a>, <a href="https://www.iacr.org/conferences/asiacrypt2016/www.asiacrypt2016.org/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ASIACRYPT 2016</a>, <a href="https://troll.iis.sinica.edu.tw/pkc16/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PKC 2016</a>, and <a href="https://www.math.auckland.ac.nz/~sgal018/AC2015/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ASIACRYPT 2015</a>, among others.
